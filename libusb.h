 * Under Windows, the selection of available compilers and configurations
 * means that, unlike other platforms, there is not <em>one true calling
 * convention</em> (calling convention: the manner in which parameters are
 * passed to functions in the generated assembly code).
 *
 * Matching the Windows API itself, libusb uses the WINAPI convention (which
 * translates to the <tt>stdcall</tt> convention) and guarantees that the
 * library is compiled in this way. The public header file also includes
 * appropriate annotations so that your own software will use the right
 * convention, even if another convention is being used by default within
 * your codebase.
 *
 * The one consideration that you must apply in your software is to mark
 * all functions which you use as libusb callbacks with this 
 * annotation, so that they too get compiled for the correct calling
 * convention.
 *
 * On non-Windows operating systems, this macro is defined as nothing. This
 * means that you can apply it to your code without worrying about
 * cross-platform compatibility.
 */

 * return type, before the function name. See internal documentation for

/** \ingroup libusb_hotplug
 * Hotplug callback function type. When requesting hotplug event notifications,
 * you pass a pointer to a callback function of this type.
 *
 * This callback may be called by an internal event thread and as such it is
 * recommended the callback do minimal processing before returning.
 *
 * libusb will call this function later, when a matching event had happened on
 * a matching device. See \ref libusb_hotplug for more information.
 *
 * It is safe to call either libusb_hotplug_register_callback() or
 * libusb_hotplug_deregister_callback() from within a callback function.
 *
 * Since version 1.0.16, \ref LIBUSB_API_VERSION >= 0x01000102
 *
 * \param ctx            context of this notification
 * \param device         libusb_device this event occurred on
 * \param event          event that occurred
 * \param user_data      user data provided when this callback was registered
 * \returns bool whether this callback is finished processing events.
 *                       returning 1 will cause this callback to be deregistered
